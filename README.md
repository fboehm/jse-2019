# jse-2019

materials for a Journal of Statistics Education manuscript. Bret and I are the two authors

In late 2019, JSE issued a call for papers. See the flyer in doc/ subdirectory.

We submitted an abstract to the call, and received a little feedback. 

We are now using this repository to write the manuscript. 

We want to draw heavily on Nolan and Temple Lang's 2010 article.
