# jse-2019

materials for a Journal of Statistics Education manuscript. Bret and I are the two authors

In late 2019, JSE issued a call for papers. See the flyer in doc/ subdirectory.

We submitted an abstract to the call, and received a little feedback. 

We are now using this repository to write the manuscript. 

We want to draw heavily on Nolan and Temple Lang's 2010 article.




## Timeline

December 15, 2019 Submission Deadline. Flier is in `doc` subdirectory.

Preparing Your Paper
Articles, Data Sets and Stories, Research in K-12, Interviews with Statistics Educators
Should be written with the following elements in the following order: title page; abstract; keywords; main text introduction, materials and methods, results, discussion; acknowledgments; declaration of interest statement; references; appendices (as appropriate); table(s) with caption(s) (on individual pages); figures; figure captions (as a list)
Should contain an unstructured abstract of 200 words.
Should contain between 3 and 6 keywords. Read making your article more discoverable, including information on choosing a title and search engine optimization.
Do not include references in the abstract. Keywords should not include any words found in the article title.
Style Guidelines
Please refer to these quick style guidelines when preparing your paper, rather than any published articles or a sample copy.

Please use American spelling style consistently throughout your manuscript.

Please use double quotation marks, except where “a quotation is ‘within’ a quotation”. Please note that long quotations should be indented without quotation marks.

General Comments on Style - Footnotes should be used rarely, and should not contain mathematical expressions. Authors are also asked to avoid abbreviations as much as possible.

Represent exponentials by "exp( )." Write fractions in text using a solidus—for example (w+x)/(y+z). Do not use overbars extending over more than one character, or underbars. Use boldface for each symbol representing a vector or a matrix (e.g., A). Avoid confusion between ambiguous characters (e.g., between lowercase el and one). Specific comments on mathematical material are provided in the ASA Style Guide.

Mathematics and Equations - Roman letters used in mathematical expressions as variables must be italicized. Roman letters used as part of multiletter function names should not be italicized. Subscripts and superscripts must be a smaller font size than the main text. Type short mathematical expressions inline. Longer expressions must appear as display math, as must expressions using many different levels (e.g., such as fractions).

Ensure that Equations are typed or created with a plug-in, such as Word Formula Editor or MathType. Mathematical expressions must not be displayed as images. Important definitions or concepts can also be set off as display math. Number your equations sequentially. Insert a blank line before and after each equation, and place equation numbers on the right.

When proofing your document, pay particular attention to the rendering of the mathematics, especially symbols and notation drawn from other-than-standard fonts.

Formatting and Templates
Papers may be submitted in Word or LaTeX formats. Figures should be saved separately from the text. To assist you in preparing your paper, we provide formatting template(s).

Word templates are available for this journal. Please save the template to your hard drive, ready for use.

If you are not able to use the template via the links (or if you have any other template queries) please contact us here.

LaTeX - Manuscripts submitted in LaTeX should use the "article" style and should not use any special macros. Manuscripts should have margins of 1 inch and text should be double-spaced.

Authors should use BiBTeX to prepare references whenever possible. Please use natbib.sty, and either plain.bst or apalike.bst to format references. Following acceptance, please be sure to include the .bib and .bbl files when your manuscript files are requested.

JSE requires that all papers be formatted for 8 1/2 x 11-inch paper, one side only, and in a sufficiently large font size and with sufficient margins to be easily read and reviewed. Specifically, we require submitters to upload a version formatted throughout with 12 point, fully double-spaced font (which we define as 750 words per page) and with text width of about 6 inches. While the font in the body of your paper should be 12, make sure that the font size used for your tables and captions is also large enough to be easily read.

Article Structure
– Articles should be formatted as follows:
1. Introduction (titling this section is optional)
2. Subsequent sections, including tables, references to figures, and figure captions
3. Appendices (if any)
Headings (e.g., title of sections) should be distinguished from the main body text. Clearly indicate the heading hierarchy, and be consistent in whether or not you use headline case, or you capitalize the first word and leave the rest in lower-case. Footnotes are discouraged. The use of abbreviations and acronyms is permitted provided they are defined the first time they are used.

Length - There is no average or recommended length for a JSE article. Authors should certainly avoid over-long papers, as they tend to burden our reviewers, elicit negative reviews, and discourage readership. Number all pages consecutively. The manuscript must contain an abstract (see the abstracts paragraph, which follows) and from three to six key words or phrases that do not appear in the paper's title. Refer to the ASA Style Guide for more detailed information. Copies of unpublished papers and technical reports cited in the manuscript and needed for review should be included with the submitted manuscript.

Figures and Tables - Figures and tables should be numbered consecutively with Arabic numerals, and clearly titled and labeled. Tables and figures should appear in the body of the manuscript as soon as possible following their first reference, not in separate files nor at the end after the bibliography. Once an article is accepted for publication in the journal, the author must supply figures in usable form; detailed guidelines for preparation of figures and tables are provided in the ASA Style Guide.

Figure files are preferred in eps or ps format, but other formats (pdf, tif, jpg, bmp, png) are acceptable, provided that the figures are of reproduction-ready quality. Check that all lines and shadings are sufficiently dense to reproduce legibly when sized to the journal's format. Lettering of all figures should be uniform in style.

Figure legends: Provide a short descriptive title and a legend to make each figure self-explanatory on separate pages. Explain all symbols used in the figures. Remember to use the same abbreviations as in the text body.

Number tables consecutively using Arabic numerals. Tables should appear in the document near where they are referenced in the text. Provide a short descriptive title, column headings, and (if necessary) footnotes to make each table self-explanatory. Refer to tables in the text as Table 1, 2 etc. Use Table 1, etc. in the table legends. Tables must not be displayed as images.

Data and Code - The ASA strongly encourages authors to submit datasets, code, other programs, and/or extended appendices that are directly relevant to their submitted articles. These materials are valuable to users of the ASA's journals and further the profession's commitment to reproducible research. Whenever a dataset is used, its source should be fully documented and the data should be made available as on online supplement. Exceptions for reasons of security or confidentiality may be granted by the Editor. Whenever specific code has been used to implement or illustrate the results of a paper, that code should be made available if possible.

Articles reporting results based on computation should provide enough information so that readers can evaluate the quality of the results. Such information includes estimated accuracy of results, as well as descriptions of pseudorandom-number generators, numerical algorithms, programming languages, and major software components used.

Supplementary Materials - Supplementary file(s) may contain (1) technical derivations and proofs that are used to support the results in the manuscript; (2) computer codes or executable computer programs used to perform the numerical studies reported in the manuscript; and (3) datasets used in the manuscript, unless prohibited by confidentiality requirements. The Authors need to use their best judgment in deciding what should be included in the manuscript and what should be in the supplementary material. The supplementary file(s) will be available to all reviewers and thus must be blinded. Necessary comments or instructions on how to execute the computer programs should be provided. If your manuscript is accepted for publication, the supplementary material may be posted online at the JSE website.

Appendices - Lengthy technical portions of a manuscript should appear in a separate appendix to the manuscript. Long appendices should be submitted as supplementary material (see above section on supplements).

Accepted Manuscripts Online
This journal posts manuscripts online as rapidly as possible, as a PDF of the final, accepted (but unedited and uncorrected) paper. This is clearly identified as an unedited manuscript and is referred to as the Accepted Manuscript Online (AMO). No changes will be made to the content of the original paper for the AMO version, but after copyediting, typesetting, and review of the resulting proof, the final corrected version (the Version of Record [VoR]) will be published, replacing the AMO version.

The VoR is the article in its final, definitive, and citable form (this may not be immediately paginated, but is the version that will appear in an issue of the journal). Both the AMO version and VoR can be cited using the same DOI (digital object identifier). To ensure rapid publication, we ask you to return your signed publishing agreement as quickly as possible and return corrections within 48 hours of receiving your proofs.
