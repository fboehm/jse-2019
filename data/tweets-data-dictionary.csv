Using a signed 64 bit integer for storing this identifier is safe. Use id_str for fetching the identifier to stay on the safe side. See Twitter IDs, JSON and Snowflake . Example:
""id"":1050118621198921728"

Note that while native retweets may have their toplevel text property shortened, the original text will be available under the retweeted_status object and the truncated parameter will be set to the value of the original status (in most cases, false ).

""truncated"":true"
