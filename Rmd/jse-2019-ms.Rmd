## Introduction


## Methods

- how did we/they conceive of projects?

We mentored two data science researchers in the last year of undergraduate study in statistics at University of Wisconsin-Madison. Both students developed novel research questions, collected observational data, analyzed data, and interpreted results. 



- how did we balance our input with that of the students?
- What data did we use?
- How did we collect data? (which packages, code to sample twitter). How did Jinyu get her stock market data? 
- What is the sampling scheme - for the 1% sample - from the entirety of Twitter? (Cite the webpage that documents the API)
