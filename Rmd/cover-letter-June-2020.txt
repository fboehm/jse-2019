Dear editors:

We wish to submit our data sets and stories piece to the special issue on computing in the curriculum. The data that we present is a collection of tweets from Twitter. We also 
provide user instructions for collecting tweets with reproducible R code. We describe a case study that uses tweets to detect a social media event. We place the case study within a larger training 
framework that draws on backward design principles to create learning objectives and 
assessment tools for undergraduate research projects.
We complement the article text with hyperlinks (in the de-anonymized pdf) to 
student project deliverables.

Thank you for your consideration of this submission.

Sincerely,

Fred Boehm
