# README.md

jse-special-issue-2020.Rmd is the manuscript that we're preparing for submission in June 2020. 

It will be a "data sets and stories" piece.

I'm still figuring out what that means. It appears that structure - section headings - vary widely among DSS pieces. I particularly like the Li et al. piece on loan approval.


## Updates from August 2020

The manuscript, pending minor revisions, is accepted for publication. We need to complete revisions before Oct 1 2020. 

We've started the document "reply-to-reviewers.Rmd" to list and address, one by one, the suggestions from the three reviewers.
