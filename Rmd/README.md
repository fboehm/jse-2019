jse-special-issue-2020.Rmd is the manuscript that we're preparing for submission in June 2020. 

It will be a "data sets and stories" piece.

I'm still figuring out what that means. It appears that structure - section headings - vary widely among DSS pieces. I particularly like the Li et al. piece on loan approval.
