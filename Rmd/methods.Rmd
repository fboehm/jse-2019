## Methods

We designed and used a framework for mentored undergraduate data science research projects with big data. Our framework draws heavily on ideas in @nolan2010computing. Specifically, we incorporate the three key aspects that @nolan2010computing identified: 

1. broaden statistical computing to include emerging areas
1. deepen computational reasoning skills
1. combine computational topics with data analysis in the practice of statistics

Our mentored research framework begins with brainstorming research ideas based on the student's interests. From there, we (mentor and student together) formulate the most promising ideas into scientific hypotheses. For the most appealing hypotheses, we encourage the student to translate the scientific question into a statistical question that may be addressed with data analysis. 











1. Overview of our framework
  a. student-led, hypothesis-driven research
  b. BH and FB helped with data acquisition
  c. helped with research question formulation
  d. how to describe roles for students v mentors?

Our framework for mentored student research projects involves these components:

    


1. State the questions and research hypotheses that the two students chose
  
1. Data description


  





- how did we/they conceive of projects?




- how did we balance our input with that of the students?
- What data did we use?
- How did we collect data? (which packages, code to sample twitter). How did Jinyu get her stock market data? 
- What is the sampling scheme - for the 1% sample - from the entirety of Twitter? (Cite the webpage that documents the API)
