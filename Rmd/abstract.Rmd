# Abstract

We backward design
a mentoring framework to guide undergraduate researchers
through individualized research projects in social media data science. 
Our framework involves research question formulation, data acquisition, data 
analysis and visualization, and presentation and communication of results. Our two honors students, 
whose projects serve as case studies for our framework, completed all components of the 
individualized research projects. We found that data science research skills, self-confidence in 
research ability, and professional interest in data science increased for both 
students. We describe our successes, lessons learned, and ideas for others to 
build similar frameworks.
