> The main message of this article is that the digital age is having a
> profound impact on statistics and the nature of data analysis, and
> these changes necessitate reevaluation of the training and education
> practices in statistics.

> Successful statisticians must be facile with the computer, for they
> are expected to be able to access data from various sources, apply the
> latest statistical methodologies, and communicate their findings to
> others in novel ways and via new media.

> When they graduate, what ought our students be able to do
> computationally, and are we preparing them adequately in this regard?

> Do we provide students the essential skills needed to engage in
> statistical problem solving and keep abreast of new technologies as
> they evolve?

> Do our students build the confidence needed to overcome computational
> challenges to, for example, reliably design and run a synthetic
> experiment or carry out a comprehensive data analysis?

> Overall, are we doing a good job preparing students who are ready to
> engage in and succeed at statistical inquiry?

Nolan and Temple Lang (2010) identify “three key aspects”:

1.  broaden statistical computing to include emerging areas
2.  deepen computational reasoning skills
3.  combine computational topics with data analysis in the practice of
    statistics
