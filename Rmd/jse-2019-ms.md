## Abstract

To explore social media data science as a pedagogical tool, we develop a
teaching and mentoring framework to guide undergraduate researchers
through individualized research projects. We demonstrate our approach by
describing our mentoring experience with two undergraduate researchers.
These projects involved Twitter data, Facebook data, topic modeling, and
sentiment analysis. Our framework involves research question
formulation, data acquisition, data analysis and visualization, and
presentation of results. Our two student projects, which serve as case
studies for our framework, completed all components of the
individualized research projects. We found that research skills,
self-confidence in research ability, and professional interest in data
science increased for both students. Below, we describe our successes,
lessons learned, and ideas for others to build similar frameworks for
future honors projects.

## Introduction

## Methods

We designed and used a framework for mentored undergraduate data science
research projects with big data. Our framework draws heavily on ideas in
Nolan and Temple Lang (2010). Specifically, we incorporate the three key
aspects that Nolan and Temple Lang (2010) identified:

1.  broaden statistical computing to include emerging areas
2.  deepen computational reasoning skills
3.  combine computational topics with data analysis in the practice of
    statistics

Our mentored research framework begins with brainstorming scientific
research ideas based on the student’s interests. From there, we (mentor
and student together) formulate the most promising ideas into scientific
hypotheses. For the most appealing hypotheses, we encourage the student
to translate the scientific question into a statistical question that
may be addressed with data.

**justify each step**

1.  Overview of our framework

<!-- end list -->

1.  student-led, hypothesis-driven research
2.  BH and FB helped with data acquisition
3.  helped with research question formulation
4.  how to describe roles for students v mentors?

Our framework for mentored student research projects involves these
components:

1.  State the questions and research hypotheses that the two students
    chose

2.  Data description

<!-- end list -->

  - how did we/they conceive of projects?

  - how did we balance our input with that of the students?

  - What data did we use?

  - How did we collect data? (which packages, code to sample twitter).
    How did Jinyu get her stock market data?

  - What is the sampling scheme - for the 1% sample - from the entirety
    of Twitter? (Cite the webpage that documents the API)

## Results

We applied the project framework to our mentoring of two students. Both
engaged in 12 months of mentored research during their senior year of
undergraduate studies in statistics in 2015 and 2016.

### Student Outcomes

We subjectively assessed student outcomes through conversations in our
weekly student research meetings.

One student later enrolled in a statistics graduate program, while the
other pursued employment in health care analytics.

### Mentor Outcomes

### Scholarly outcomes & deliverables

## Discussion

### Benefits of our framework

Benefits of our
framework

### How does the framework relate to ideas in Nolan and Temple Lang 2010??

### Critiques of our framework

Our measures of students’ self-confidence in research ability was merely
subjective. In future iterations of our framework, we would like to
measure systematic and objective outcomes. One strategy for implementing
this is to administer a survey, such as \_\_\_, both before and after
the mentored research project. We would use validated survey questions
that focused on student beliefs about themselves and their skills.
