1. List title ideas - how to word it??

Social media data science: a mentored research framework
What do we want title to say about our article???

1. Clean up text about time period start times. This is very awkward right now!!

How to tell the cotemporaneous stories: 
    a. mentoring undergrad research with tweets
    b. analyzing tweets & what they tell us


Since we're writing for "Datasets and stories", maybe we focus on describing the data set, how we got it, what one can do with it, and how 
one can teach with it.
    - which tweet json fields come with every tweet? Which are optional??
